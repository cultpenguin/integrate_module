# # INTEGRATE Timing Analysis Example
#
# This example demonstrates how to perform comprehensive timing analysis of the INTEGRATE workflow
# using the built-in timing_compute() and timing_plot() functions. 
#
# The timing analysis benchmarks four main components:
# 1. Prior model generation (layered geological models)
# 2. Forward modeling using GA-AEM electromagnetic simulation  
# 3. Rejection sampling for Bayesian inversion
# 4. Posterior statistics computation
#
# Results are automatically saved and comprehensive plots are generated showing:
# - Performance scaling with dataset size and processor count
# - Speedup analysis and parallel efficiency
# - Comparisons with traditional least squares and MCMC methods
# - Component-wise timing breakdowns

# ## Understanding Timing Results
#
# The timing analysis provides insights into:
#
# ### Performance Scaling
# - How execution time varies with dataset size
# - Parallel efficiency across different processor counts
# - Identification of computational bottlenecks
#
# ### Component Analysis  
# - Relative time spent in each workflow component
# - Which components benefit most from parallelization
# - Memory vs compute-bound identification
#
# ### Comparison Baselines
# - Performance relative to traditional least squares methods
# - Comparison with MCMC sampling approaches
# - Cost-benefit analysis of different configurations
#
# ### Optimization Guidance
# - Optimal processor counts for different dataset sizes
# - Sweet spots for price-performance ratios
# - Scaling behavior for production deployments

# ## Tips for Timing Analysis
#
# 1. **Start Small**: Begin with quick tests using small N_arr and Nproc_arr
# 2. **System Warm-up**: First runs may be slower due to system initialization
# 3. **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor CPU, memory usage during large tests
# 4. **Reproducibility**: Results may vary between runs due to system load
# 5. **Hardware Specific**: Results are specific to your hardware configuration
# 6. **Baseline Comparison**: Compare with known reference systems when possible
